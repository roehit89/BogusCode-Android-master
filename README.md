### Vimeo Mobile & TV Apps Group
#### Android Coding Exercise

BogusCode is an app that fetches and displays the first page of videos in the [Vimeo Staff Picks channel](https://developer.vimeo.com/api/endpoints). However, the codebase and user experience are suboptimal to say the least.  

Youâ€™ve inherited BogusCode and your task is to elevate it to your own standard of quality. Correct all of the issues you see, refactor as you see fit, and make BogusCode clean, clear, performant and scalable. 

We're looking for the following in no particular order:

* A bug-free app that displays the Staff Picks list
* Architectural clarity, architecture that can scale
* Clean, clear, attractive UI

Adding new features and functionality is not necessary. But if you're interested in taking on some extra credit tasks here are a few ideas: 

* JSON response caching
* Image caching
* Pagination

With your returned submission please modify the `README` to contain a brief summary of the issues you identified, the changes you made to correct them, and rationale behind those changes.

Feel free to send us any questions that might arise along the way. And good luck!

*Note: The use of third party libraries is not allowed. Submissions that leverage third party code will be disqualified. Additionally, we strongly discourage copying and pasting blocks of code from any other sources. However, if you can make a strong case for using someone else's code, please comment thoroughly to show an understanding in addition to crediting the source and the rationale.*
